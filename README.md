# LeetCode Python Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to LeetCode problems, implemented in Python. The goal is to solve one LeetCode problem every day.

Inspired by [mzyui/leetcode-rs](https://github.com/mzyui/leetcode-rs).

## Problem Index

| # | Title | Difficulty | Category | Solution |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Two Sum | Easy | Array, Hash Table | [Python](./solutions/1.two-sum.py) |

## Project Structure

*   `solutions/`: Contains the Python solution files for each LeetCode problem.
*   `scripts/`: Contains utility scripts, including the script to update this README.
*   `README.md`: This file, which is auto-generated by a script.

## Workflow

1.  Add a new solution file to the `solutions/` directory, following the naming convention: `<number>.<slug-title>.py`.
2.  Add comments to the top of the file for `Difficulty` and `Category`.
3.  Run the update script: `python scripts/update_readme.py`.
4.  The script will automatically regenerate this `README.md` to include the new solution.
